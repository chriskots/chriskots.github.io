            <h2>Employer</h2>
            <p>During my 2019 Summer work term I worked at the Toronto office of Munich Re, Canada. Munich Re’s head office is located in Munich Germany and has operations in more than 30 countries. Munich Re is a reinsurance company that provides reinsurance to insurance companies in Canada and around the world. Insurance companies purchase reinsurance to limit their exposure to the risk of paying out significant claims in the same way individuals purchase insurance to limited their exposure to the risk of having to pay health or property damage costs themselves.<br><br>Munich Re’s Human Resource staffing requirements continually change resulting in a need to have an effective automated employee onboarding process when new employees are hired. Munich Re’s previous process consisted of many complicated, duplicated and manual steps that resulted in significant administration hours, inefficiencies and errors. My role at Munich Re was to create, design and test a tool that would automate the onboarding process.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <h1>What were your goals/learning outcomes for this work term?</h1>
            <p>My goals and learning outcomes for this work term included, expanding my interest and desire to design using a variety of tools and software products, promoting effective communication with the owners of the onboarding process to ensure their objectives and concerns were understood, ensuring an effective long term solution and to perform in a team environment that demonstrates both collaboration and independence.</p>
            <h1>What skills did you want to learn? How will these tasks benefit your next work experience?</h1>
            <p>Over this work term I wanted to learn to provide software solutions using both back-end development and front-end design. I felt that this would be very helpful with future work experiences as many softwares consist of a back-end and front-end development. Although I have generally been more interested in the back-end development, it is important to experience the connection between both front-end visual and back-end technical requirements.</p>
            <h1>What technologies did you want to work with and why?</h1>
            <p>During this work term I wanted to work with HTHML and CSS languages. I felt that learning more about these languages would help me become a stronger front-end developer. This work term experience provided me with an opportunity to work with both HTHML and CSS to create easy to use user-friendly websites and applications.</p>
            <h1>What goals did you complete? What goals were you not successful in completing and why?</h1>
            <p>My goals were generally completed during my Munich Re work term. I was able to expand my design skills, continue to explore new languages, communicate effectively and independently provide solutions.</p>
            <h2>Job Description</h2>
            <p>As a SharePoint Developer from June 2019 to August 2019, I was required to support Microsoft software applications including SharePoint, Powerapps and Flow to develop a beginning to end solution to streamline and automate the new employee onboarding process used by recruiters and department managers. My responsibilities included identifying and interpreting expectations, development of the sites and applications, including workflow and technical documentation.<br><br>SharePoint was used to control the stored data to be passed throughout the process. Powerapps were developed to make front end applications that were provided to the users, the data was then passed to SharePoint and Flow provided the the control for the necessary steps to ensure all tasks were completed efficiently.</p>
            <h2>Conclusions</h2>
            <p>Overall this was a really exciting work term and I am glad that I had the opportunity to work with Munich Re to create a solution that will be used for many years to come. It was very enjoyable to learn and use new softwares to make a difference in the workplace.</p>

            <h2>Employer</h2>
            <p>During my 2019 Fall work term I worked at the Waterloo office of NCR, Canada. NCR is a digital banking company that is well known for many technologies such as self-service kiosks, automated teller machines,  and cheque processing systems. NCR provides services to a large range of other companies such as RBC, CIBC, and Cineplex. This digital banking can range from a ATM machine in a mall to a way to buy tickets in a movie theater.<br><br>NCR was asked to provide a company with the way to bank online. A lot of the features of the banking requirements were already implemented so me and 5 others were tasked to create a website to manage and allow this company to bank online using NCR's services. NCR is an older company and usually works with older technology but felt that it was good to make a change to newer technologies, it was decided that we would use React instead of Angular (which was a project before I got to NCR).</p>
            
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <h1>What were your goals/learning outcomes for this work term?</h1>
            <p>My goals and learning outcomes for this work term included, learning more about React and front-end development, becoming more familiar with the agile methodology, and having a better design possibility using React.</p>
            <h1>What skills did you want to learn? How will these tasks benefit your next work experience?</h1>
            <p>During this work term I wanted to learn more about the fullstack development. I felt that this would be very helpful for many different work experiences because it utilizes front-end and back-end development.</p>
            <h1>What technologies did you want to work with and why?</h1>
            <p>At the beginning of this work term I was very excited to work with object oriented programming using Java. We started a new project that used the react framework heavily so I started gaining an interest in React. After using React for a few small projects I was hooked and wanted to test my skills with side projects during this work term.</p>
            <h1>What goals did you complete? What goals were you not successful in completing and why?</h1>
            <p>I believe that I have met all of my goals. I was able to learn more about React, I worked with the agile methodology a lot during this work term and got used to it, and I worked hard to make better possible designs and websites using React</p>
            <h2>Job Description</h2>
            <p>As a Software Developer at NCR from September 2019 to December 2019, I started off the work term making test code in Java and ensuring quality assurance. As we went on with the work term I was given more responsibilities and I got to work on a lot of Java code to correctly collect required data from databases and give it to the new React front-end. After working on Java we moved on to a new project using React. This project was to use pre-existing functionality from NCR, we used React to make a front-end that a user can interact with to deposit cheques via scanner.<br><br>This new project will be worked on for the next few co-ops that work at NCR because the functionality is too large to complete in 4 months. I believe that me and my co-workers left the project at a good place to be easily picked back up and completed with the best practices.</p>
            <h2>Conclusions</h2>
            <p>Overall this was a really great work term and I believe that I learn a lot of new and innovative development techniques that I will definitely utilize for next work terms and jobs. It was very fun to learn these new frameworks and to meet new connections that I will keep in touch with for years to come.</p>
