            <h2>Employer</h2>
            <p>During my 2019 Summer work term I worked at the Toronto office of Munich Re, Canada. Munich Re’s head office is located in Munich Germany and has operations in more than 30 countries. Munich Re is a reinsurance company that provides reinsurance to insurance companies in Canada and around the world. Insurance companies purchase reinsurance to limit their exposure to the risk of paying out significant claims in the same way individuals purchase insurance to limited their exposure to the risk of having to pay health or property damage costs themselves.<br><br>Munich Re’s Human Resource staffing requirements continually change resulting in a need to have an effective automated employee onboarding process when new employees are hired. Munich Re’s previous process consisted of many complicated, duplicated and manual steps that resulted in significant administration hours, inefficiencies and errors. My role at Munich Re was to create, design and test a tool that would automate the onboarding process.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <h1>What were your goals/learning outcomes for this work term?</h1>
            <p>My goals and learning outcomes for this work term included, expanding my interest and desire to design using a variety of tools and software products, promoting effective communication with the owners of the onboarding process to ensure their objectives and concerns were understood, ensuring an effective long term solution and to perform in a team environment that demonstrates both collaboration and independence.</p>
            <h1>What skills did you want to learn? How will these tasks benefit your next work experience?</h1>
            <p>Over this work term I wanted to learn to provide software solutions using both back-end development and front-end design. I felt that this would be very helpful with future work experiences as many softwares consist of a back-end and front-end development. Although I have generally been more interested in the back-end development, it is important to experience the connection between both front-end visual and back-end technical requirements.</p>
            <h1>What technologies did you want to work with and why?</h1>
            <p>During this work term I wanted to work with HTHML and CSS languages. I felt that learning more about these languages would help me become a stronger front-end developer. This work term experience provided me with an opportunity to work with both HTHML and CSS to create easy to use user-friendly websites and applications.</p>
            <h1>What goals did you complete? What goals were you not successful in completing and why?</h1>
            <p>My goals were generally completed during my Munich Re work term. I was able to expand my design skills, continue to explore new languages, communicate effectively and independently provide solutions.</p>
            <h2>Job Description</h2>
            <p>As a SharePoint Developer from June 2019 to August 2019, I was required to support Microsoft software applications including SharePoint, Powerapps and Flow to develop a beginning to end solution to streamline and automate the new employee onboarding process used by recruiters and department managers. My responsibilities included identifying and interpreting expectations, development of the sites and applications, including workflow and technical documentation.<br><br>SharePoint was used to control the stored data to be passed throughout the process. Powerapps were developed to make front end applications that were provided to the users, the data was then passed to SharePoint and Flow provided the the control for the necessary steps to ensure all tasks were completed efficiently.</p>
            <h2>Conclusions</h2>
            <p>Overall this was a really exciting work term and I am glad that I had the opportunity to work with Munich Re to create a solution that will be used for many years to come. It was very enjoyable to learn and use new softwares to make a difference in the workplace.</p>
