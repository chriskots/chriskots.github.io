            <h2>Employer</h2>
            <p>Over the Summer 2019 work term I was working at Munich Re. Munich Re is based out of Munich but I was working in the downtown Toronto office. Munich Re is a Reinsurance company that provides services to other companies in the insurance world. The concept of reinsurance is that a insurance company will need to be ensured if the payout for insurance is expensive. When I was working here I was creating and designing the onboarding process based on their previous concepts. The reason why they wanted to update their onboarding process is because it consisted of many complicated steps to get the person to start.</p>
            
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <h1>What were your goals/learning outcomes for this work term?</h1>
            <p>First was, have more of a keen eye for design. My second on was to have better communication with people in my department for them to voice their opinions on the websites. My third one was to make more captivating and interesting meetings for people in my department.</p>
            <h1>What skills did you want to learn? How will these tasks benefit your next work experience?</h1>
            <p>Over this co-op I really wanted to get more into design. I feel that this will be very helpful with my next work experiences because most softwares consist of a backend and a frontend. I have always been more interested in the backend development, but if I could be interested in frontend development too, I'd be able to develop both beautiful and technical projects.</p>
            <h1>What technologies did you want to work with and why?</h1>
            <p>During this co-op term I wanted to work with HTHML and CSS. I felt that learning more about these languages would help me become a better frontend developer. After I finished this work term I feel that I learned a lot when it comes to these languages and I have had the capability to make nicer websites.</p>
            <h1>What goals did you complete? What goals were you not successful in completing and why?</h1>
            <p>I feel that I was able to complete all my goals this co-op term. I believe I completed these easier because they were more of a starting goal and were easier to complete. For my next co-op terms I feel like I will make harder goals so I can push myself to make more of an impact in my learning.</p>
            <h2>Job Description</h2>
            <p>I worked as a SharePoint Developer from June 2019 to August 2019. Over the co-op I worked with some microsoft softwares called SharePoint, Powerapps, and Flow. I used these apps to make the on-boarding process at Munich Re more smooth for the recruiters and some of the departments in the company. I used SharePoint as a way to control the stored data that will be passed througout the process. I used Powerapps to make frontend applications that are given to the users, these apps take data from the user and pass it to the SharePoint. When the data was passed to SharePoint I used flow to control what steps are needed when a certain tasks is completed.</p>
            <h2>Conclusions</h2>
            <p>Overall this was a really fun co-op and I am glad that I had the opportunity to create a project that will be used for many years to come. It was very enjoyable to learn and use new softwares to make a difference in the workplace.</p>
