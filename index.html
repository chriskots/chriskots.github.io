            <h2>Employer</h2>
            <p>During my 2019 Summer work term I worked at the Toronto office of Munich Re, Canada. Munich Re’s head office is located in Munich Germany and has operations in more than 30 countries. Munich Re is a reinsurance company that provides reinsurance to insurance companies in Canada and around the world. Insurance companies purchase reinsurance to limit their exposure to the risk of paying out significant claims in the same way individuals purchase insurance to limited their exposure to the risk of having to pay health or property damage costs themselves.<br><br>Munich Re’s Human Resource staffing requirements continually change resulting in a need to have an effective automated employee onboarding process when new employees are hired. Munich Re’s previous process consisted of many complicated, duplicated and manual steps that resulted in significant administration hours, inefficiencies and errors. My role at Munich Re was to create, design and test a tool that would automate the onboarding process.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <h1>What were your goals/learning outcomes for this work term?</h1>
            <p>My goals and learning outcomes for this work term included, expanding my interest and desire to design using a variety of tools and software products, promoting effective communication with the owners of the onboarding process to ensure their objectives and concerns were understood, ensuring an effective long term solution and to perform in a team environment that demonstrates both collaboration and independence.</p>
            <h1>What skills did you want to learn? How will these tasks benefit your next work experience?</h1>
            <p>Over this work term I wanted to learn to provide software solutions using both back-end development and front-end design. I felt that this would be very helpful with future work experiences as many softwares consist of a back-end and front-end development. Although I have generally been more interested in the back-end development, it is important to experience the connection between both front-end visual and back-end technical requirements.</p>
            <h1>What technologies did you want to work with and why?</h1>
            <p>During this work term I wanted to work with HTHML and CSS languages. I felt that learning more about these languages would help me become a stronger front-end developer. This work term experience provided me with an opportunity to work with both HTHML and CSS to create easy to use user-friendly websites and applications.</p>
            <h1>What goals did you complete? What goals were you not successful in completing and why?</h1>
            <p>My goals were generally completed during my Munich Re work term. I was able to expand my design skills, continue to explore new languages, communicate effectively and independently provide solutions.</p>
            <h2>Job Description</h2>
            <p>As a SharePoint Developer from June 2019 to August 2019, I was required to support Microsoft software applications including SharePoint, Powerapps and Flow to develop a beginning to end solution to streamline and automate the new employee onboarding process used by recruiters and department managers. My responsibilities included identifying and interpreting expectations, development of the sites and applications, including workflow and technical documentation.<br><br>SharePoint was used to control the stored data to be passed throughout the process. Powerapps were developed to make front end applications that were provided to the users, the data was then passed to SharePoint and Flow provided the the control for the necessary steps to ensure all tasks were completed efficiently.</p>
            <h2>Conclusions</h2>
            <p>Overall this was a really exciting work term and I am glad that I had the opportunity to work with Munich Re to create a solution that will be used for many years to come. It was very enjoyable to learn and use new softwares to make a difference in the workplace.</p>

            <h2>Employer</h2>
            <p>During my 2019 Fall work term I worked at the Waterloo office of NCR, Canada. NCR offers products and services such as software, e-commerce technology, payment and imaging, and retail point of sale. The NCR financial institutions division develops banking and technology solutions for self-service kiosks, automated teller machines, and cheques processing systems.<br><br>Working for a Canadian financial institution, NCR was asked to enhance the bank’s online banking through the development and implementation of web-based check depositing application/tool. The project involved finding innovative new technology solutions to create a new website based on NCR's online banking services with React.</p>
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <h1>What were your goals/learning outcomes for this work term?</h1>
            <p>My goals and learning outcomes for this work term included; learning more about React and front-end web development, becoming more familiar with Agile methodology, and exploring better design possibility with React.</p>
            <h1>What skills did you want to learn? How will these tasks benefit your next work experience?</h1>
            <p>During this work term I wanted to learn more about Full Stack development. I felt this would be very useful in future work experiences since it utilizes both front-end and back-end development. This will be very helpful for my future work terms because I intend to follow the path of Full Stack development.</p>
            <h1>What technologies did you want to work with and why?</h1>
            <p>I was very excited to work with Java as the primary object oriented programming. React was the framework selected for the NCR project; after working with React I became extremely interested in its capabilities and began testing the skills I learned on personal side projects.</p>
            <h1>What goals did you complete? What goals were you not successful in completing and why?</h1>
            <p>I met all of my goals. During this work term; I worked with and learned the power and functionality of React, I became comfortable with the Agile methodology and I was given an opportunity to create well thought out designs and websites using React.</p>
            <h2>Job Description</h2>
            <p>As a Software Developer at NCR from September 2019 to December 2019, my work term job description changed as the project progressed and certain key milestones were met. I was responsible for developing/writing test code in Java and ensuring quality assurance. Using Java code I helped automate the collection of required data from databases to be used in React. Using pre-existing NCR functionality, I worked with the 5 person co-op team using React to make a front end website that users/banking customers could interact with to deposit cheques via scanner or other data imaging sources.<br><br>This long term project will continue to be worked on by future NCR co-ops as the functionality and requirements are too large to complete in four months. My co-op team and I progressed the project and ensured it was in good standing and could be easily picked up and completed with the best practices.</p>
            <h2>Conclusions</h2>
            <p>Overall, this was a great work term and I believe that I learned a lot of new and innovative development techniques that I will definitely utilize for next work terms and future software development positions. If was very exciting to learn new frameworks and to make new connections that I will keep in touch with for years to come.</p>

            <h2>Employer</h2>
            <p>During my 2020 Summer work term I worked for the University of Guelph as a research student for Daniel Gillis.</p>
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <h1>What were your goals/learning outcomes for this work term?</h1>
            <p>My goals and learning oucomes for this work term included; Learning more about websockets and Socket.IO, manage time wisely to ensure that I can complete my assignment because this was an online co-op, and relaying how my assignment is going to my supervisors so they can stay in the loop with the progress of the assignment.</p>
            <h1>What skills did you want to learn? How will these tasks benefit your next work experience?</h1>
            <p>During this co-op term I wanted to learn more about websockets and how they can be useful. For a side project of mine I was beginning to work on a messaging system which would utilize websockets to allow live communication. In this co-op term I was able to make a messaging system for people playing the game to communicate which would be very useful for my projects and for my future work terms.</p>
            <h1>What technologies did you want to work with and why?</h1>
            <p>I wanted to work with React and Socket.IO which I felt were the perfect couple to do the assignment assigned to me. I felt that these technologies were the best to use for this specific project because they wanted to have a game on the guelph website that could have users enter rooms and play the card game. Since I was already comfortable with React I felt that it was best to utilize a websocket technology that could also complement React which was Socket.IO.</p>
            <h1>What goals did you complete? What goals were you not successful in completing and why?</h1>
            <p>I was able to meet all of my goals. I worked used websockets throughout the co-op with the help from Socket.IO, I was able to manage my time wisely which in doing so advanced my organizational skills and time management skills, also since the co-op was all online I kept track of all the things I was doing to ease the process of describing what I was working on for that week during our weekly meetings.</p>
            <h2>Job Description</h2>
            <p>As a research student for this co-op term I was able to work with professors at the university to turn a card game online which was from the response for COVID-19 that brought all of the classes online for the upcoming semester. Utilizing React and Socket.IO I was able to make the cardgame. The cardgame was a 3 - 6 player game in which the purpose is to survive starvation. But as the rounds go on it becomes more and more difficult. At the end of every round there was trading and purchases of asset cards (which make the game easier the more assets you have). At the end of my work term I set up the code to be transfered to another co-op coming in who could finalize all the requirements as well as port it to a server on the Guelph website.</p>
            <h2>Conclusions</h2>
            <p>Overall, this was a great work term as I was able to show off my technical skills as well as my individual working skills. With both of these skills it made it easier to create this game from scratch. I am excited to use my skills learned from this co-op in my future jobs as well as my personal projects.</p>
